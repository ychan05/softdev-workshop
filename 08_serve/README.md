### PREDICTIONS:
- v0: We predict that __name__ and "No hablo queso!" would be on the webpage
	* outcome: __main__ was on the terminal, and no hablo queso was on webpage
- v1: We predict that __name__ would not be on terminal, but it would print No hablo on the webpage.
	* outcome: we was right
- v2: We predict that "about to print" and main would be on terminal, and no hablo queso on webpage
	* outcome: we was right
- v3: we expected our debugger to automatically refresh our webpage when edits were made
	* outcome: we would still need ot save our file as well as refresh our webpage, but we dont need to terminate
- v4: We predict that there will be a debug still running as no files are iportant
	* outcome: we was right
### DISCO:
- discovered where flask is run (through our localhost, 127.0.0.1:5000
- we learned that there was an autorefresh if debug was on, meaning we wouldnt have to terminate each session
- we learned that the debug code would not change per instance of webpage
- 
### QCC
- can we change the port its run through/does it matter?
- how do we have multiple functions run in app.py
