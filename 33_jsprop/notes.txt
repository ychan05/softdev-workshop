Q: When user clicks on a cell, in what order will the pop-ups appear?

The cell first, row 2nd, then table last

Q: What will happen when next line is uncommented?
  //e.stopPropagation();
Only one pop up will show up.

Q: When user clicks on a cell, in what order will the pop-ups appear?
    //table.addEventListener('click', clicky, true);
The event listener with arg true will appear first.


//Q: Does the order in which the event listeners are attached matter?

//Predict, then test...
//Q: What effect does the boolean arg have in each?
//   (Leave exactly 1 version uncommented to test...)

for (var x=0; x < tds.length; x++) {
  tds[x].addEventListener('click', clicky, true);
  // tds[x].addEventListener('click', clicky, false);
}

for (x=0; x < trs.length; x++) {
  trs[x].addEventListener('click', clicky, true);
  //trs[x].addEventListener('click', clicky, false);
}

table.addEventListener('click', clicky, true);
//table.addEventListener('click', clicky, false);

ORDER TYPED IN DOES NOT MATTER (WHERE THE FUNCTIONS ARE TYPED)
CAPTURING: When true, POPUPS are based on HEIRARCHY (big guys #1) ARE PRIORITIZED (BIGGER ID'S WILL BE FIRST) (table, tr, td)
BUBBLING : When false, POPUPS are based on REVERSE HEIRARCHY (small guys #1). (td, tr, table) (DEFAULT) 
Falses will always be after trues.
