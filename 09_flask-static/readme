2022-10-11

PREDICTIONS:
- opening http://localhost:5000/static/foo will display some text on the webpage
	- it instead downloaded the foo file to the Downloads directory
- opening  http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html will display text on the webpage
	- webpage displayed "Is this plaintext, though"

DISCO:
- opening a plaintext file on a flask webpage will download the file to the local machine
- opening html file will display the text on a webpage

QCC
- Can we display a static and dynamic file on the same webpage?
- Can we refer to static files in a dynamic file?
