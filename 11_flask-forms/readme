K11: Form(s) Like Voltron // form submission
2022-10-14
time spent: 0.5 hours

Predictions:
1. dspl_page
  1. prints stuff to terminal
  2. construct header in form
  3. put template

2. authenticate
  1. the args dictionary will be updated with user inputs

DISCO:
- A HTTP 405 error is thrown when GET is excluded from method field in app.route()
- the args dictionary is updated with user inputs
- the request method isn't needed to load and use webpage in browser, but stores user inputs.
- When the methods are included in app.route(), we cannot access the values stored in request.args


QCC:
- What are GET and POST requests?
- How are do they differ?
